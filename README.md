<h3><i>Overview</h3>
<p>
In this project I have created a web application in Python to recognise digits in images. User can visit the web 
application through their browser (instructions below - How to run the application). User can draw an image containing a single digit 
in the canvas, and the web application will respond with the digit contained in the image. 
I used tensorflow and flask to do the project.
